## Recommended Steps

### Confirm Zai could satisfy your needs

Major features of Zai are introduced in [README](../README.md), 
if there is something you are interested in, move on!

### Read Architecture Docs

Docs are [here](arch). It will help you to know Zai better.

### Read FAQ

After some reading, you must have lots of questions. [FAQ](FAQ.md)

### Follow the Dev-Guide

I don't think it's a good idea to regard Zai as a out-of-the-box enterprise application.
It's a user-defined lib actually.

Storage system should be highly customizable in my opinion.
